# crypto_scrapper
A simple python gui to show the latest prices of crypto coins
This program uses python and bs4 to scrape the data from websites which show the real time prices of crypto coins.

Iam looking to expand upon this project to add a data analysis of the variation in prices of coins to give a detailed analysis to the user.
